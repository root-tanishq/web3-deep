# RoadMap
Here is the roadmap I’m currently following 
Introduction and Basics:
Basics of Blockchain.
Speaking Web3/Blockchain
What is a smart contract and how do they work?

Introduction to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):
EVM Architecture & Working
Ethereum Accounts, Transactions & Gas
ABI, Byte code and OpCode

Introduction to Solidity:
Solidity IDEs and frameworks (Remix and Foundry)
Solidity language specifics.
Writing and deploying your first smart contract
Exploring and Interacting with the contracts on blockchain (local and public)

Smart Contract bug/vulnerability classes and exploits - I:
Arithmetic over and under flows
Re-entrancy
Access Control
Insecure Randomness
Input validation
Writing exploits/PoCs for the discussed vulnerabilities

Overview of DeFi Concepts and related attacks

Smart Contract bug/vulnerability classes and exploits - II:
Business Logic
Storage collisions
Insecure low level calls
Frontrunning/Race Conditions
Function signature collision
Writing exploits/PoCs for the discussed vulnerabilities

Reproducing a real-world hack from scratch:
On-chain analysis of the attack
Local setup for the attack
Reproducing the attack

Automation and Tooling:
Static Analysis using slither
Dynamic Analysis using Echidna.
