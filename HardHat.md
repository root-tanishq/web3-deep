# HardHat 
- Hardhat is a robust development framework tailored for Ethereum smart contract development, equipped with comprehensive testing, debugging, and deployment features, facilitating efficient and streamlined blockchain development workflows for Solidity projects.
- In simple words:- It runs a local blockchain and provide some other utility along with it.
- Its more efficient then truffle
- migration is easy in hardhat rather than truffle
