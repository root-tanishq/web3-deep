# Types of Tokens:-
## ERC20
- A fungible interchangable token mainly created for transactions.
- Mainly created for interacting with DAPPS and smart contract applications.
- ERC20 tokens are fungible digital assets on the Ethereum blockchain, commonly utilized for creating cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and facilitating decentralized applications (dApps), offering seamless interoperability and widespread adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem.
- There are set of structured functions need to be used in smart contract to create ERC20 based contract.
- A secure ERC20 template widely used -> https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol
- and also allowance function means I give some rights to a person or a smart contract or some marketplace to execute transactions with my account on my behalf for someone like trader or manager or to work as a middle man.
## ERC721
- ERC721 is a standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. It was proposed by Dieter Shirley in January 2018 and has since become one of the most widely used standards for creating unique digital assets on the Ethereum network. Unlike ERC20 tokens, which are fungible and interchangeable (1 token is the same as any other token of the same type), ERC721 tokens are unique and cannot be exchanged on a one-to-one basis.
- ERC721 token is used to register non unique assets 
- Assets can not be interchange as the assets is uniquely owned

## ERC1155
- ERC1155 is a token standard on the Ethereum blockchain that allows for the creation of both fungible and non-fungible tokens within a single contract. This standard offers increased efficiency and flexibility for developers, enabling them to manage multiple token types within a single smart contract, reducing gas costs and enhancing scalability. Additionally, ERC1155 supports batch transfers and atomic swaps, making it suitable for various use cases such as gaming, digital collectibles, and asset tokenization. 
- Its mostly created for video games .
- In simple words the assets are not unique they are in multiple quantity for people to purchase or trade with it .
